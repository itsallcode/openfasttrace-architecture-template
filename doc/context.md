# System Scope and Context

> OFT: Often you will find the general system context in your system requirement specification (SRS) already. Whether or not to copy that depends on if you prefer to present a mostly self-contained architecture document or to focus on the single-source principle (DRY).

> OFT: We recommend that you at least provide a context diagram in this document since that is one of the most helpful parts when it comes to understanding the architecture.
