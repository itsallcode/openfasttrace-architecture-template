# Solution Strategy

> OFT: This chapter is a tricky one. The original arc42 template states that you should outline your main architectural decisions here, for example how you plan to reach your quality goals.

> OFT: While we can understand the benefits of drawing lines on a grand scale, this approach has multiple problems.

> OFT: First understanding those decisions usually requires knowledge of details that will appear in later chapters. Decisions that are not justified by facts that you presented before are hard to accept for your readers.

> OFT: Second this chapter is bound to create duplicated information especially when compared to the [Design Decisions](design_decisions.md) chapter and duplications are a major source of error.

> OFT: Third the job of a system or software architecture is to keep as many decision options open for as long as possible. If you draw the lines to early and to strictly you are removing freedom from the designers that could have given you a better overall solution. 

> OFT: Our recommendation is to remove this chapter unless you have uncountermandable decisions that everyone needs to get over before starting to work on a solution. A prime example would be if your company enforces a strict book of standards for technical systems that does not allow for solutions outside of that box. In this case you can either deal with it and find the best remaining solution within the confines of these regulations, spend your time trying to get the book of standards adapted to your needs or leave for a company that understands the necessity of picking the right tool for the job.
